                I am Bryce Haw. I currently live in Milaca, Minneosta. I have graduated from
                St. Cloud Technical College with a degree in Computer Programming.
                I started gaining interest in programming when I was 14. I would mess around with
                C++ not knowing what I was doing. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in 
                programming where I learned to code in various Object Oriented Programming languages such as 
                C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Dart, HTML and CSS, as well as languages like NoSQL and MySQL.

                I love to learn new things and I believe that's why I love to code. 
                Being able to learn new things everyday
                and not being able to know everything is exciting. 
                The stuggle to figure something out and having to spend time to figure it out 
                is a joy. When I can finally get the issue resolved it gives me so much 
                excitement that programming could never become dull.
